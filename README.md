Hey,
This is Shahriar Ahmed Shovon and <b>React Covid Tracker</b> is a platform to get live update covid situation. This web app will provide absolute data from famous api for covid 19 tracking project. You can do here 
<ol>
  <li>Get Data of your current location</li>
  <li>Death, Infected and recovered data</li>
  <li>Live update data based on country</li>
</ol>

Maybe I will add some features like
<ol>
  <li>Graph Presententation</li>
  <li>State baesd data</li>
</ol>

## Technology I used

<ol>
  <li>React 16.13.x</li>
  <li>Axios</li>
  <li>Context API</li>
  <li>React Bootstrap</li>
</ol>

## Conslusion

Actually I could make this project more feature enabled and beautiful but I was just experimenting with some react feature. When I got succeed on the experiment then I just pushed it on github and never cared for this. And also my code is so ugly to read. There are no comment and standard rules to follow. I apologize for that, and thanks a lot for visiting my code.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
